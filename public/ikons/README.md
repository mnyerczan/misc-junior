# Dear Candidate!

Thank you very much for showing interest in an open position at **Jacsomedia Smart Web Applications**. We are happy to inform you that based on your CV and experience, we think you might be the perfect applicant to fill this position and join our team. Therefore, we would like to **know more about your professional competencies**. If you convince us during the entry test about your professional skills, we would like to invite you to an interview and get to know you personally.

## Task 1:
In **step one**, create a PHP site based on the attached PSD (design/SP-design.psd) file. We are mostly interested in your **CSS and HTML** knowledge. The site should mirror the outlook of the design as much as possible. It does not have to be a responsive result. Optional you can use SCSS or Less if you would like to.
## Task 2:
The **second step** is to measure your **PHP and MySQL** skills. Create a **working login page** for the site you have just created. The login should compare the entered data with the data stored in **database** and run **the verification process the most secure way**. In case the entered username-password combination is **incorrect** (admin, admin123), **a warning message should come up**. Only in case the combination is correct, then users should be navigated to the next page. Users not logged in should not be able to navigate to different menu points. You can write your own business logic, or you can use any framework (Laravel, Yii2, Symfony), the choice is yours.
## Task 3:
**Step three** is about your **JavaScript** skills. You will have to create a **‘grab and take’ list**, where **items can be arranged**, and their arranged position can be **stored in a database** by a single click. The two columns are independent from one another and each item can be placed anywhere. Provide feedback to the user after successful saving. If you would like to use any library (jQuery, React, Angular, VueJs) go for it, or you prefer Vanilla JS it is alright too.

Upload the completed task **to your Github or Gitlab** account with your database dump and send the link to this email address: **cseter.gabor@jacsomedia.hu**. If you have any question just drop a mail to the email address above. These tasks can be finished in 210 minutes.
